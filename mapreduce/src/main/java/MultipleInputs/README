Working with multiple input files

In this example we are going to deal with multiple input file, to simulate a simple join.

Input Files 

Customer :

Mobile,Name
123,mani
456,vijay
888,ravi

Delivery

Mobile,Staus
123,0
888,1
456,1


The task is to write a map reduce program to get a joined outout in the following manner

mani	0
vijay	1
ravi	1

The concept here is to identify key from multiple input file, pull relevant data and stich them together in reduce. This is typicaly how to handle join.
